# **README – Microburbs Live Suburb Dashboard**

This project is a lightweight analytics application that demonstrates how to integrate the Microburbs sandbox API with a modern Python/Flask backend to produce a clean, interactive, real-estate insights dashboard. The entire system takes a suburb name and optional property-type filter as user input, calls the Microburbs `/suburb/properties` endpoint using a simple requests-based client, and transforms the deeply nested JSON response into a structured Pandas DataFrame via a custom flattening function. The backend then performs several key analytics steps, including numeric cleaning of fields like price, bedrooms, bathrooms and land or building sizes, extracting integers from strings such as “605 m²”, converting listing dates to datetime, computing summary statistics such as median, mean, min, max, and generating grouped metrics such as yearly listing counts, median price by property type, and median price by bedroom count. This cleaned dataset is then passed to a visually polished dashboard rendered through Jinja2 templates, styled in a white–and–purple theme, and populated with three live charts—yearly listings, price by property type, and price by bedrooms—built entirely in vanilla JavaScript using Chart.js for a dependency-light frontend footprint.  The application is deployment-ready: `requirements.txt` specifies Flask, Pandas, Requests, Gunicorn; `app.py` defines all routes including `/` for search ; the `templates/` folder contains two pages (`index.html` for input and `dashboard.html` for results); and the `static/` folder holds the client-side dashboard JavaScript. When hosted on Render, the project uses a build command (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and a start command (`gunicorn app:app`), making it fully compatible with GitHub-based continuous deployment. Overall, this project demonstrates full-stack competency—API integration, data wrangling, interactive visualisation, lightweight design, dynamic reporting, and cloud deployment while remaining small, understandable, and easy to extend for future features like maps, filters, caching, or nationwide pre-computation.
